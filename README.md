## About this proyect 

* How long you spent on the assignment.

This project took me approximately 5 hours, I did it in two stages, the first day 1 hour and a half and the last day more than 3 hours


* What you like about your implementation.

What I like about my implementation is that it can organize the project in the best possible way and solve what was asked.

* What you would change if you were going to do it again.

If I had to do it again I would try to modularize the components more into smaller, reusable components. I would also create some custom Hooks to manage the logic and I would look into improving the responsive part of the project.

* How you made your design decisions. For example, if you looked at other timelines for inspiration, please note that.

To carry out the design, look for some references to take into account how to solve the problem.

* How you would test this if you had more time.

I would test by performing unit tests on each of the components, ensuring that they render correctly and that the behavior of the events is as desired, using test libraries such as Jest.
I would also do more exhaustive tests manually, generating my test matrix with different test data.
